<p><strong>The point of PROVisualizer is to give first time researchers a high-level view of the archives.</strong></p>
<p>We only identify and house a selection of records created or received  by Victorian government bodies including departments, authorities, courts and municipalities. The data about these records  is regularly updated. If you’re looking for collections created by private individuals or non-government bodies you might want to try the State Library or non-government archives.</p>
<p>Click on the dropdown menu under <strong>Function</strong> (activity of government) to browse the areas of government we hold records about or try a keyword search. You can filter any results by entering a year.</p>

	<td><p>A yellow circle represents a government <strong>agency</strong> responsible for administering a function of government for a particular period of time. Many agencies may be connected to the same government <strong>function</strong>  because responsibility for it has changed over time. Also, many agencies, especially large Departments, are responsible for a number of different functions simultaneously. </p><p>Clicking on an agency label will take you to a list of records (<strong>Series</strong>) created by the agency that are documented in our catalogue.</p></td>

<p>The darker and bigger a circle, the more connections it has to other functions, agencies, or series.
<p>When you roll your cursor over a circle, a label will appear identifying that function, agency, or series. Click on the label to learn more about it in our online catalogue on a separate page.</p>
<p>If you are looking at a highly connected function or agency you might need to
move things around to get a better view. Here’s the best way to do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Roll your mouse over a function, agency or series. When you see the cursor turn into cross arrows click and drag the function or agency circle to another part of the screen. Anything connected to it will come along for the ride!</li>
	<li>Click on any empty space on the screen then drag to move the entire visualisation.</li>
	<li>Click on any empty space on the screen then double click to zoom in. You can zoom in and out by also rolling your mouse wheel.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just click on the <img src="share.png" style="margin: 0px"/> icon. You can
