	<td>A yellow circle represents a government agency or body (<strong>V</strong>ictorian <strong>A</strong>gency) responsible for administering an activity
(function) of government. Clicking on an agency label will take you to a list of records
created by the agency that we preserve. There are many agencies connected to the same government
function because responsibility for it has changed over time. Since 1836 different agencies have been responsible for
different activities of government, and transfer the records they create to us for
long-term preservation.</td>

<p>The <strong>darker</strong> and <strong>bigger</strong> a circle, the more connections it has to other functions
and or agencies and might be a good place to start your research journey.</p>
<p>When you click on an agency label you will see a list of records (Victorian Series) created by
that agency.</p>
<p>When you roll your cursor over a circle, a label will appear identifying that function or
agency. Click on the label to learn more about it in our online catalogue on a separate page.</p>
<p>If you are looking at a <strong>highly connected</strong> function or agency you might need to
move things around to get a better view. Hereâ€™s the best way to do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Roll your mouse over a function or agency. When you see the cursor turn into cross arrows click and drag the function or agency circle to another part of the screen. Anything connected to it will come along for the ride!</li>
	<li>Click on any empty space on the screen then drag to move the entire visualisation.</li>
	<li>Click on any empty space on the screen then double click to zoom in You can zoom in and out by also rolling your mouse wheel.</li>
